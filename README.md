A project repository for a project I've recently worked on that that Machine Learning NLP concepts to recommend books

As an avid reader myself, I found it quite fascinating working on this project. In the .ipynb notebook file, you will find the book recommendation system I've worked on that uses TF-IDF to help recommend books. It recommends books based on:
1. The book's authors
2. The book's Title
3. The book's Description
4. The book's Genre

I intend to add further features in the future such as recommedning books based on a user's rating and collaborative filtering
